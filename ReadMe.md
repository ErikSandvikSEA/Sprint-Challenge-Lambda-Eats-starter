# Single Page Applications Sprint Challenge

The sprint challenge is your chance to independently work through material and
build on what you learned this week. In today's project you will build a form
for Lambda Eats, a website designed to bring food to hungry coders.

## Introduction

In this challenge you will be working from the `Lambda Eats` homepage to create
a functional `Pizza?` button that leads to a build your own pizza custom form.

## **Self-Study Questions**

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the
following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to
leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read
by your Team Lead.

1. In 1-2 sentences, explain what React's `useRouteMatch` hook is used for.

   The useRouteMatch hook allows us to easily add nested routes to the
   application. You can change a single parameter in a URL without having to
   rewrite the whole thing. Example being
   website.com/about/employee1/employee-details and
   website.com/about/employee2/employee-details: using useRouteMatch, you could
   pop the employee# portion of the URL into a parameter like employeeUrl and
   place it into the url as website.com/about/\${employeeUrl}/employee-details
   so it's less labor intensive to write the URLs for that route.

2) How would you explain form validation to someone who has never programmed
   before?

   On websites with login forms or other types of forms that require user input,
   we need to make sure that the user can only submit the form after the form
   has been filled in correctly. Say for example the username needs to have at
   least 3 characters - we need to build a schema that shows an error if there
   are fewer than 3 characters and we need to make sure the form submit function
   is disabled.

3. In 1-2 sentences, define end to end testing.

   End to end testing looks at the entire user experience of a
   page/app/component. It focuses on the user interface and mimics events on the
   page, such as clicks, text typing, scrolling, etc, and tests for errors that
   may otherwise take too long to test out manually.

You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses
contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section **will**
prevent you from passing this challenge.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

-  [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
-  [ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
-  [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
-  [ ] CD into the project base directoryÂ `cd lambda-eats`
-  [ ] Download project dependencies by running `npm install`
-  [ ] Start up the app usingÂ `npm start`
-  [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -bÂ `<firstName-lastName>`. Implement
       the project on your newly createdÂ `<firstName-lastName>`Â branch,
       committing changes regularly.
-  [ ] Push commits: git push originÂ `<firstName-lastName>`.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Your MVP should include, at a minimum, the following components.

-  [ ] A homepage that has a "/" route and links to your form (button, nav bar,
       or any other type of link is acceptable)
-  [ ] A form with a "/pizza" route
-  [ ] A name text input field
-  [ ] Validation for name - name must be at least 2 characters
-  [ ] Dropdown form component for pizza size
-  [ ] Checklist form component for toppings - at least 4 (hint: name each
       separately!)
-  [ ] Text input form component for special instructions
-  [ ] An Add to Order button that submits form and returns a database record of
       name, pizza size, sauce, and special instructions

#### Testing MVP

Implement the following tests in Cypress:

-  [ ] test that you can add text to the box
-  [ ] test that you can select multiple toppings
-  [ ] test that you can submit the form

You may use the following wireframe (also in a folder above) as guidance as you
design your site but it is not required that you do so.

## Task 3: Stretch Goals

If you complete the MVP, move on to the following stretch goals. As usual, these
goals represent a mix of additional at-level work in addition to work that is
beyond the scope of what you've learned, but attainable with your current
knowledge (and google).

-  [ ] Toggle form component for gluten free crust
-  [ ] Turn your form into a modal that pops up on the home page
-  [ ] Turn form element sections into nested routes
-  [ ] Create a `cart` page with additional form options like: delivery or
       pickup, the option to add utensils and straws, add a tip, etc.
-  [ ] Test more of the application with Cypress
-  [ ] Add functionality to your order button that it leads to a Congrats! Pizza
       is on it's way! page **and** returns a database record of the whole order

## FAQs

**How do I return a database record of the order?**

One of your goals is to return a database record of the order - for this you'll
need to write a post request. For more detailed steps, use the below:

1. Create a new state
2. Post to [reqres](https://reqres.in/) database with `axios`
3. Log data in console

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

-  [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master
       (student's Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
-  [ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
-  [ ] Your TL will count the project as complete by merging the branch back
       into master.
